# Terrain Erosion
A sort-of-hacked-together terrain erosion simulator that happens to produce some nice art.
You'll need Processing (processing.org) to run this simulation. It uses Processing's Java mode.
Please credit me (Nathanael Page or JavaMatrix) in any works created with this software. If you feel like sending me a link to the work, that'd be much appreciated as well!
